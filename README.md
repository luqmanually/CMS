# CMS24 - Crypto Mining Simulator

A Kaboom.js-based crypto mining simulator game. Not realistic.

## How it works

The mining async function does the following math for every single GPU you have every 100ms:

```js
btc += gpu hashrate / mining difficulty
```

This project has been set from the ground up to record and store data that may help with analytics.

## Support

I am mostly active on Discord (luqmanually) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/luqmanually). I check [Twitter](https://twitter.com/luqmanually) roughly every day or two. Any advice, tips or feedbacks are welcomed.

### Notes and Disclaimers

Please remember that this project does **not** resemble or is related to any real-life mining activities. It is a fun side-project of mine, and is purely for entertainment. I am not associated with any Bitcoin-related entities, or Nvidia.

#### Currently, this project is in Alpha.
